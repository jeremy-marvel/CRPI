\subsection{Detailed Description}
Function implementation for managing A\+R\+CL connections to the Omron Adept ld mobile robot platform. ~\newline
This code is for the outgoing arcl connection, whereby this control program opens ~\newline
a server connection and the ld core connects as a client. ~\newline
. 

The Outgoing arcl connection can be configured in Mobile Planner uncer Configuration-\/$>$Robot Interface-\/$>$Outgoing A\+R\+CL Connection Setup and should ~\newline
be given the address and port number used on this machine to establish the server socket. ~\newline
 For details about the Outgoing A\+R\+CL connection, see the A\+R\+CL User Guide by Adept, and personal notes that summarizes communications. ~\newline
