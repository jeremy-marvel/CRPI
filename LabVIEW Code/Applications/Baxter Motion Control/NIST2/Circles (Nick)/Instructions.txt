To run Pivots

1) Open "Initialize Function.vi"
   Select "Right Arm" and "Left Arm"
   Run

2) Open & run "Status.vi"

3) Open "Pivot Bar.vi"
   Set Angles ("start" and "end"), speed, radius, & center
   Run
   Program will complain if it can't find an IK solution
   Save data when requested

4) Open "Run File.vi"
   Browse for file from last step
   Run 
   Arms will go through one cycle and stop at 'start' points.

5) Attach measuring bar.
   If bar doesn't fit, repeat steps 4&5 with different radius

There are three ways to run the routine

A) Select "Right&Left" arms and 0 delay in "Run File.vi"
   This is the "best" cooperation. Arms run simultaneous motions.

B) Select "Right&Left" arms and #>0 delay in "Run File.vi"
   This delays the motion of the right arm causing incremental errors.

C) Run a setup cycle using (A) above.
   Open "Follow.vi"
   Set "Idle Left" to FALSE (light off)
   Run "Follow.vi" - right arm will follow the left arm
   Select "Left" arm and 0 delay in "Run File.vi"
   The arms will run as Leader/Follower (i.e., Master/Slave)
   This version would be most like an industrial use.
